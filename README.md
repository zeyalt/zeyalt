## Hello and welcome! üëã

- Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! My name is Zeya and I am a practising data scientist with the Singapore Police Force. I am a former Police officer and I took the leap of faith in 2020 with a mid-career switch into Data Science.   

- When I first started my Data Science journey in 2018, I had little background in statistics, computer science or programming. My learning curve was steep, so I made deliberate efforts to simplify complex data science concepts. That's how I found myself learning most effectively. 

- Having gone through that process, I'm inspired to share my knowledge and help others learn Data Science better. In my articles, I aim to break down concepts into simple, bite-sized chunks with clear  explanations. I will also share useful code snippets that may help you improve your coding skills. 

- This GitHub portfolio is as much an effort towards helping people learn Data Science better as it is my own endeavour to document my Data Science journey.
